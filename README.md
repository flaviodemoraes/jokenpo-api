### JOKENPO API

In this repository is a very simple example of an API for the Jokenp√¥ game.

The game is the user against the App.

Game rule:
* Rock wins from scissors and loses to paper;
* Paper wins from rock and loses to scissors;
* Scissors wins from paper and loses to rock.

The results are messages informing if the user won, lost or tied with the App, also showing the choice made by the app.

The application is a REST type API developed in ASP.Net Core 5.
